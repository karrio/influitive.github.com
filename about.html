title: About Influitive.
lead: "We are on a mission, to put customer advocates at the core of marketing strategy and execution."
---

<p>We believe that mobilizing customer advocates represents the future of marketing. Mobilized and engaged advocates are able to drive targeted awareness, accelerate buying processes and help close deals more effectively than traditional investments in marketing and sales. We see a world where the first instinct of a marketer faced with a tough challenge is to rally their advocates. An advocate-centered world is better place for all of us. In the future, companies will be compelled more than ever to produce fantastic products and services that turn customers into evangelical fans.</p>
