          <h1>What We Do.</h1>
          <p class='lead'>At Influitive, we are passionate about advocates. We have interviewed hundreds of them and reviewed scores of academic research on advocates to understand what makes them tick. What we know is that advocates increase their performance when they receive the kind of experience they seek. What kind of experience fires up advocates? We break it down into three categories:</p>

            <img src='images/vip.png' />
          </div>
          <div class='span10'>
            <h2>VIP Status</h2>
            <p>Advocates want special treatment. They want the best service, they want to be recognized, and be given special perks available only to them.</p>
            
            <p>They are not looking for money, discounts and gadgets, although they will not turn them down. They more inspired by their special status and the knowledge, skill and experience their status represents.</p>

          </div>
          <div class='span10'>
            <h2>Part of the Team</h2>
            <p>Advocates have wrapped part of their identity with the companies that they advocate for, and they value being consulted. They like to provide new ideas for products, services, and marketing campaigns.</p>

            <p>Top performing companies know that advocates are somewhere on the continuum between an ordinary customer and an employee. By taking their counsel, providing them with tools to help them exercise their advocacy more effectively, and giving them personalized rewards, new levels of advocate performance can be unleashed.</p>

          <div class='span10'>
            <h2>Move the Meter</h2>
            <p>Advocates enjoy seeing the impact of their advocacy on their favored companies. They want to receive more than just thanks, they want feedback, and to understand their results. Did their reference result in a sale? How many views did their video testimonial receive? What happened to that last product idea they submitted?</p>

            <p>Companies that compete on advocate performance excel in helping their advocates understand how they are impacting results both at the micro and macro levels.</p>

In the future, companies will be compelled more than ever to produce fantastic products and services that turn customers into evangelical fans.</p>
