    <h2>Part of the Team</h2>
    <p>Advocates have wrapped part of their identity with the companies that they advocate for, and they value being consulted. They like to provide new ideas for products, services, and marketing campaigns.</p>

    <p>Top performing companies know that advocates are somewhere on the continuum between an ordinary customer and an employee. By taking their counsel, providing them with tools to help them exercise their advocacy more effectively, and giving them personalized rewards, new levels of advocate performance can be unleashed.</p>

    <h2>Move the Meter</h2>
    <p>Advocates enjoy seeing the impact of their advocacy on their favored companies. They want to receive more than just thanks, they want feedback, and to understand their results. Did their reference result in a sale? How many views did their video testimonial receive? What happened to that last product idea they submitted?</p>

    <p>Companies that compete on advocate performance excel in helping their advocates understand how they are impacting results both at the micro and macro levels.</p>
