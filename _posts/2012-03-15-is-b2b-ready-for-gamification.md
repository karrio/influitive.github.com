  author: Julie
  lead: "Yesterday, at the Summit on Customer Engagement, Influitive presented a workshop on basic principles of gamification and how they can be applied to mobilize customer advocates.

Well folks, there are none, other than our customers … yet.  Much of the innovation in B2B gets its start on the consumer web.  Salesforce.com provides several great examples of this.  Its core SFA app was reminiscent of Amazon.com and Chatter is a lot like a Twitter feed.  If you want to know what is coming next in B2B marketing technologies, it is wise to see what is happening on the consumer side.

We did not have to wait long to prove the point.  The crowd started to talk. The buzz was building.  The session attendees – all of whom are B2B executives, with plenty of C-level executives in the crowd - were also playing an influence and persuasion game on the SCE2012 AdvocateHub.  Here is the Twitter stream during and after the event:

It’s quite simple, actually: provide your advocates with an engaging experience, and the quality and quantity of their activity goes up.  B2C or B2B, C-level or rank-and-file.
